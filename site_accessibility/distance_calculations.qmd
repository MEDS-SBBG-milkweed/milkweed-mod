## Setup


Read in cleaned trails & roads data 

- data was cleaned in the `data_cleaning/trails_and_roads` folder `trails_and_roads.qmd` notebook, and outputs were written to the `clean_data` folder


```{r}
# ------------------- Forest Watch -------------------------

# Trails (South Only)
forest_trails_south <- st_read(here("~/../../capstone/milkweedmod/clean_data/trails_roads/forest_trails_south.shp"))

# Roads (South Only)
forest_roads_south <- st_read(here("~/../../capstone/milkweedmod/clean_data/trails_roads/forest_roads_south.shp"))

# ---------------------- USGS -----------------------------

# ........... Trails ................

# North
usgs_trails_north <- st_read(here("~/../../capstone/milkweedmod/clean_data/trails_roads/usgs_trails_north.shp"))

# South
usgs_trails_south <- st_read(here("~/../../capstone/milkweedmod/clean_data/trails_and_roads/usgs_trails_south.shp"))

# ............. Roads .................

# North
usgs_roads_north <- st_read(here("~/../../capstone/milkweedmod/data/clean_data/trails_roads/usgs_roads_north.shp"))

# South
usgs_roads_south <- st_read(here("~/../../capstone/milkweedmod/data/clean_data/trails_roads/usgs_roads_south.shp"))
